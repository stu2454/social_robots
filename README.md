# Social & Companion Robotics for Ageing and Disability  
*A sceptical, evidence-led backgrounder for founders, providers and policymakers*  
**Date:** September 2025

---

## Overview
This repository explores the opportunities and limits of **social and companion robotics** in the context of Australia’s ageing population, the longevity economy, and disability supports (NDIS).  

The full backgrounder provides:
- A synthesis of **peer-reviewed and grey literature** on social robots (e.g. PARO, Pepper, ElliQ).  
- A review of **Australian policy and funding pathways** (Aged Care reforms, NDIS AT).  
- A discussion of **regulatory, privacy, and interoperability** requirements (TGA, APPs, Essential Eight, HL7 FHIR/MyHR).  
- A **market and competitive landscape** analysis, including Big Tech and local telecare providers.  
- Two strategic options for startups:  
  1. **Hardware-led social robot** (manufactured device)  
  2. **Agentic AI platform** (embodiment-agnostic, standards-aligned orchestration layer)  
- A **Go/No-Go decision framework** and **90-day pilot plan**.
