# Prompt: Deep Background on Social/Companion Robotics for Ageing & Disability (Australia-Centric, Evidence-Led)

## Your role
You are a senior research analyst and policy strategist specialising in the **longevity economy**, **aged care**, and **disability supports** in Australia. You will produce a **comprehensive, narrative background paper** that I can share with founders, providers, and policymakers to demonstrate thought leadership. Use **UK English** and **AUD$** throughout.

## Objectives
1. Map the **state of the evidence** on social/companion robotics for older adults and people with disability (incl. dementia care) with a critical, sceptical lens.
2. Assess the **commercial viability** in Australia, including procurement, funding pathways (Aged Care, NDIS), and competitive dynamics (incl. Big Tech and local vendors).
3. Identify **unique value propositions** for a startup with an existing hardware embodiment (manufactured in Shenzhen) versus a pivot to an **agentic, embodiment-agnostic AI platform** integrating multi-source data.
4. Provide a clear **go/no-go** decision framework, **pilot design** blueprint, and a **90-day plan** for evidence generation and market entry.

## Must-use browsing & citations
- You **must browse** and cite **both** peer-reviewed and **grey literature** (policy, regulator guidance, industry reports, reputable media).
- For peer-reviewed evidence, prioritise: **systematic reviews, meta-analyses, RCTs**, and high-quality quasi-experimental studies. Use **PubMed** queries such as: `"social robots" AND (ageing OR aging OR dementia OR older adults)`, and include work by **Wendy Moyle (Griffith University)**.
- For grey literature, consult (at minimum):  
  - **ARIIA**: Technology in aged care—robots page.  
  - **HammondCare** resources on dementia and social robots.  
  - **Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety** reports and follow-on reforms.  
  - **NDIS**: Assistive Technology advice, price guides, Evidence Advisory Committee and any assessment scopes relevant to smart/robotic tech.  
  - **Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA)** on interoperability & My Health Record.  
  - **OAIC** (Privacy Act/APPs) and government AI/technology guidance (e.g., DTA).  
  - Standards and safety: **ISO 13482 (personal care robots)**, **ISO 13485/IEC 60601/ISO 14971** (if device claims approach “medical”), **HL7 FHIR** for interoperability, **ASD Essential Eight** for cyber.  
  - **Market/industry**: Big Tech ambient/voice platforms (Google, Amazon, Apple), social robots (e.g., Paro, Pepper, ElliQ, Lovot, NAO, QTrobot, Jibo), and local sensor/telecare vendors (e.g., Tunstall, Care@Home, Telstra Health).
- **Citations**: Use **author-date** style inline (e.g., *Moyle et al., 2021*) with **clickable URLs**. Distinguish **peer-reviewed** vs **grey literature**. Include publication/last-updated dates. Flag any uncertainty or low-quality sources.

## Deliverable format
- **Length**: 12–20 pages equivalent in Markdown (with headings), plus appendices.  
- **Tone**: Analytical, sceptical, and forward-looking; avoid hype.  
- **Front matter**: Title page, 1-page Executive Summary, Table of Contents.  
- **Accessibility**: Clear headings, short paragraphs, tables/figures as needed.

## Structure & content (minimum)
1. **Executive Summary (1 page)**  
2. **Context: Ageing, Disability & the Longevity Economy (AU)**  
3. **Evidence Review: Social/Companion Robotics**  
4. **Regulatory, Privacy & Interoperability**  
5. **Market & Competitive Landscape**  
6. **Funding & Procurement Pathways (AU)**  
7. **Two Strategic Options for a Founder with Existing Hardware**  
8. **Economic Case & Impact Modelling**  
9. **Implementation Frameworks & Trial Design**  
10. **Go/No-Go Decision Tree & 90-Day Plan**  
11. **Conclusion: Where (If Anywhere) a Defensible Wedge Exists**  

## Required tables/figures
- Evidence map of outcomes vs robot type  
- Comparative TCO table  
- Competitor matrix  
- Funding pathway flowcharts  
- Risk register  
- Go/No-Go decision tree  

## Appendices (minimum)
- **Annotated bibliography**  
- **Standards & compliance checklist**  
- **Pilot artefacts**  
- **Interview guides**  
- **Glossary**  

## Style rules
- UK English; AUD$.  
- Avoid hype; **call out uncertainties and negative findings**.  
- Every claim likely to have changed since 2023 must have a source and date.  
- Short “Fact cards” with source links for any key numbers.  
- Clearly separate **opinion** from **evidence**.

## Seed items to start from
- Griffith University / **Wendy Moyle** publication list.  
- **ARIIA** robots in aged care page.  
- **HammondCare** on social robots.  
- **PubMed** query.  
- **Royal Commission** reports.  
- **NDIS** AT guidance.  
- **ADHA** interoperability.  
- **OAIC** privacy.  
- **EU AI Act** for international context.

## Output
Produce the full report in **Markdown**, including all sections, tables, figures, and a complete **References** section with clickable URLs. Ensure it stands alone and is ready to share.
